## Abstract

NexaApply is a Chrome extension that utilizes artificial intelligence to automate the detection and completion of job application forms on various web platforms. By analyzing form structures and mapping fields to user-provided profiles, NexaApply streamlines the application process, reducing manual effort and minimizing errors. The extension ensures user data privacy by storing all information locally and offers customization options for enhanced user control.

## Background

The job application process is often cumbersome and time-consuming, requiring applicants to repeatedly enter similar information across multiple platforms. This repetitive task not only leads to inefficiency but also increases the likelihood of errors, potentially affecting the success of applications. Existing solutions offer basic form-filling capabilities but lack intelligent field recognition and customization, limiting their effectiveness in diverse application environments.

## Summary

NexaApply is a sophisticated Chrome extension designed to automate the job application process by intelligently detecting form fields on job portals and auto-filling them with user-specific profile information. Leveraging advanced AI algorithms, NexaApply analyzes form structures, matches fields with relevant user data, and ensures accurate and efficient form completion. The extension prioritizes user data privacy by maintaining all information locally and provides customizable settings to cater to individual user preferences.

## Detailed Description

NexaApply integrates seamlessly with popular web browsers to provide users with an automated solution for filling out job application forms. Upon activation, the extension scans the current webpage for form elements, identifies relevant fields using the **FormAnalyzer** module, and maps them to the user's profile data stored locally. The **MistralAI** component enhances this process by analyzing the context and semantics of each field to ensure accurate data mapping.

Key Features:

- **Intelligent Field Detection:** Utilizes AI to recognize and categorize form fields accurately.
- **Customizable Profiles:** Allows users to input and manage their personal and professional information, which NexaApply uses to auto-fill applications.
- **Data Privacy:** Ensures all user data is stored securely on the local device, with encryption for sensitive information like API keys.
- **Debug Mode:** Provides detailed logs and real-time feedback to assist users in troubleshooting any issues during the auto-fill process.
- **Flexible Configuration:** Users can enable or disable features, adjust auto-fill settings, and manage their profiles through an intuitive options interface.

By automating repetitive tasks, NexaApply not only saves users valuable time but also enhances the accuracy of job applications, thereby increasing the chances of success in the competitive job market.
